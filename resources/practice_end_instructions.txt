That's the end of the practice. 

The next block of trials is the start of the real experiment. 

The experimental task is very similar, but note that as you progress from block to block some characteristics of the decks will change.

REMEMBER: Your goal is to get as many points as possible, but you can choose any deck anytime, and there will always be a choice with zero probability of shock.
